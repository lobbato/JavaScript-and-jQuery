        <h1>Front-end</h1>
      </p>

      <p>The first thing you need to decide is if you want to focus more on front-end or back-end development. Front-end
        developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and
        design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take the front-end track at Epicodus, where
        you'll learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers typically use a JavaScript framework like React,
        Angular, or Ember. While each has its differences, they've evolved to have more in common than not. Epicodus
        teaches React, because it is the most popular framework, but the skills translate into any of the other
        frameworks.</p>

      <p>
        <h1>Back-end</h1>
      </p>

      <p>If you're more interested in back-end development, you have several choices of languages: C# and Ruby are
        offered at Epicodus, and you may have heard of other languages like Java, Python, Go, and PHP. Again, my best
        advice about how to choose is not to worry too much. Most modern programming languages have more similarities
        than differences, and Epicodus graduates often find themselves working in different languages than they studied
        in school. Back-end programmers often switch languages as they change jobs, or even as they build different
        types of software at the same job. So don't stress too much about making the right choice! That said, each
        language has found a bit of a niche, and depending on your interests, you might be attracted to one over
        another.</p>

      <p>
        <h2>C#</h2>
      </p>

      <p>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been
        around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job
        market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and
        surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other
        languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice. It's
        also very similar to Java, so if you're interested in Java development, C# is a great choice at Epicodus.</p>

      <p>
        <h2>Ruby</h2>
      </p>

      <p> Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users
        creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built
        with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the
        common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies
        who are looking to build their product quickly. Like C# and Java, Ruby is very similar to Python, and Ruby is a
        great choice at Epicodus if you're interested in Python.</p>

      <p> Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired
        copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and
        PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find
        them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing.
